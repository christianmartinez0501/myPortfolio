            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a passionate Computer Science graduate from Brigham Young University of Idaho. My journey has led me to fascinating avenues in the tech world, where I am currently an QA Engineer Intern.
                I have a solid foundation in Computer Science, which I've honed my skills in various tools and technologies. I am well-versed in utilizing Git and Azure DevOps for streamlined development processes. 
                My professional pursuits aside, I'm not just a tech enthusiast I'm also a dedicated gamer, both in the digital realm and around the board. However, my interests extend beyond screens. I find joy in the great outdoors, any opportunity to hike, camp, and explore. My cherished moments are often spent surrounded by friends and family, making memories.
                In addition to these passions, I really enjoy reading books. Exploring new worlds through literature is a pastime that keeps me grounded and fuels my creativity. As I continue to learn and grow, I hold a vision of becoming a skilled software developer one day, where I can contribute innovative solutions to complex challenges in the tech industry.
                With a fervor for technology and a burning desire to shape the future as a software developer, I am excited for the adventures that lie ahead. Feel free to reach out to me whether it's a coding conundrum, a book recommendation, or discussions about the exciting realm of software development!</p>
